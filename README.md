# Alex Rosenblum
*Hello, and thank you for taking an interest in my work! I am a Data Scientist with a background in chemistry and 6 years of professional work experience (5 years in corporate environments, 18 months with a startup). My interests are in sustainable energy, social/demographic issues, logistics, music, and video games, or any combination of these things. I am an eager learner and love to work with interesting real-world data of any subject, if it means learning something new. Below you can find some personal details as well as links to a few examples of my analytics work so far. Please feel free to get in touch!*
