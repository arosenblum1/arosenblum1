### Performing NLP on Fox News Newsletters

The code for this project was written in R. LDA and PCA functions were taken from the MASS and psych packages, respectively. I wasn’t yet used to using the tidyverse stack at the time of this analysis, so all manipulation and visualization was done in base R.

I contributed the portion of the report titled “Linear Discriminant Analysis”, pages 7 - 9; my contribution is detailed more fully on pages 11 - 12.
