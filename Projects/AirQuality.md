# Regression Analysis of Chicago's Air Quality During the COVID-19 Pandemic
*The code for this project was written in **SAS**. Code  was written collaboratively as a group via Zoom call, so no individual credit can be claimed for that part of the analysis. I did, however, do a majority of the literature review for the project, and wrote the introduction in full.*
